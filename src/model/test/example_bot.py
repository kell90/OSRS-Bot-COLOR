"""
This file demonstrates how to set up a simple bot. It demonstrates how to implement the functions for
capturing user configuration of the bot, and includes a simulated bot loop that does not have any
side affects during testing.

To better understand how to implement a bot, please see the documentation for the Bot class as well as
the README/Wiki.
